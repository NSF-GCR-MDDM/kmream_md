This folder contains a pdf, called _____ that is a writeup on how to build up a molecular dynamics (MD) based simulation using the LAMMPS software for the context of ion irradiation of crystalline structures.
The order of which to run these files is given in this writeup. The output of the LAMMPS simulations is to be loaded into the OVITO software available online, which more information is 
once again given in the writeup. The output from OVITO after applying the proper modifiers is then loaded into the  `md_vacancies.ipynb` notebook for post-processing of the Frenkel pairs,
as well as calculation of the track width as a function of depth into the sample and the total track length.
