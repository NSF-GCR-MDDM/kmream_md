This folder contains .cif files to use with the python script to generate crystal files for use in LAMMPS.
The .cif file names are formatted as so: type of crystal 
                                        + temperature at which the sample the cif file is based on was kept at (if the information was given)
                                        + id of the cif file in the crystallography open database.
Information for the citations needed for each file can be found below:
